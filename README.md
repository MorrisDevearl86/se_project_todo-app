# Simple Todo App

A Website application that allows users to create, manage, and track daily tasks through a clean and user-friendly interface "The Todo List".

## Functionality

The Simple Todo App enables users to add, view, update, and remove tasks in real time. Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete, helping users visually track their progress throughout the day. The application focuses on simplicity and ease of use, making task management fast and intuitive.

The app by entering task descriptions into an input field and submitting them to a task list. Each task is displayed with action controls that allow users to mark tasks as completed or delete them entirely. Completed tasks are visually distinguished to improve clarity and usability.

The app dynamically updates the task list without requiring page reloads, ensuring a smooth user experience. This project demonstrates fundamental front-end development concepts, including state management, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
